<h1>Stephanie Chinn's Design Document</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This website will serve as a professional profile outlining skills and qualifications for my impending career as a professional librarian. It will serve as an extension of my C.V. for job search purposes.</p>
<p>The primary goal will be to advertise myself as a candidate for librarian positions and to provide additional details beyond what is present in my curriculum vitae. Additionally, this would serve as a basis for populating my faculty page at the university where I ultimately serve.</p>
<p>Prospective employers would visit this site to learn more about my education and work history, as well as the skills and projects that I have worked on. They would then be able to come away with a more complete vision of my abilities as a candidate, as well as reading anecdotal evidence of my skills and knowledge in action. This would allow them to better evaluate me both as a potential candidate for a position, but also as a potential future colleague.</p>
<p>After hiring, this site would be used by patrons and students at my new university. These users would primarily be interested in contact information but may also want to know more about my past positions. They would be seeking information about my skills and knowledge in an effort to evaluate me as an information resource.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Search committee member</h3>
<p>A member of a search committee would find this site as listed on my application/C.V. They would be looking for additional information about my skills in an effort to evaluate my fitness for the specific positions they have been charged with filling.</p>
<h3>Faculty member</h3>
<p>A faculty member would visit this page as a faculty profile page prior to inviting me to guest lecture in their class. They would find this site useful in evaluating my knowledge of various technologies and research methods do decide if I would be a good fit for what they are trying to teach their students.</p>
<h3>Student patron</h3>
<p>A student patron would visit this site largely for my contact information. They may also be looking for more information on my skills and knowledge in an effort to decide if I would be a compatible resource for a project they are working on.</p>
<h3>Prospective candidate for another position</h3>
<p>As a faculty page, this site would be visited by prospective candidates for other positions within the library. A job seeker would want to know specifics about their potential future colleagues and use the included information as a means of evaluating the culture and knowledge base of their potential future employer.</p>

<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>I surveyed five people who would use this site in various ways. Their names have been changed to protect their privacy.</p>
<ul><li>Andy is an undergraduate student and library patron.</li>
	<li>Betty is a library staff person who is serving on search committees for a librarian position.</li>	
	<li>Cathy is another staff person serving on a search committee. She is also a graduate student and will be seeking a position as a librarian in the future.</li>	
	<li>Doug is an emeritus professor who also uses the library for research.</li>	
	<li>Emma is a faculty member who utilizes librarians as guest lecturers in her classes.</li></ul>
<h4>Questions</h4>
	<ol><li><i>Why would you be interested in this site?</i>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>Andy wants to know about my interests to see if I could help him on a homework project. If our interests align, he would want my contact information.</li>
			<li>Betty wants to know about my work history, specifically detailed information on projects or grants I have worked on in the past.</li>
			<li>Cathy wants to know about my history, but also wants to know if I can help her with her own projects for school. She is interested in specifics about what I do/have done at work in order to decide if this is a path she wants to follow in her own career.</li>
			<li>Doug wants to know if I can help him with is research.</li>
			<li>Emma wants to know if I can offer any new insight in research methods to her students.</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><i>When would you access the site (at what point in your information gathering)? Would you revisit the site at any other point in your process or do you feel you would gather all of your information from a single visit?</i>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>Andy would look once when a project is assigned. He would not revisit the site unless he felt I was a good resource for his research.</li>
			<li>Betty would look during each round of evaluations, so long as I progressed through the application process. She would revisit the site to compare my purported skills against her impressions during my interview.</li>
			<li>Cathy would look at the site in the beginning of the interview process, but not again, relying on her own impressions going forward. She would also look at the site when she is nearing graduation to determine if my described job tasks align with what she wants to do. She might view the site if she thought I could help her with her homework but would probably rely mostly on her personal impressions.</li>
			<li>Doug would view the site the first time he noticed it, just to get an idea of what the new librarian does. After that, he would rely on personal impressions and the recommendations of other librarians to decide if he needs to involve me in his research.</li>
			<li>Emma would also look at the site the first time she noticed a new librarian had been hired. She might also look again if the structure of her existing classes changed or if she were teaching something new.</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li><i>What content do you feel is most important?</i>
		<ol type="A">
		<li>Andy thinks contact information and publication history are most important.</li>
		<li>Betty thinks work history and detailed information on skills/technical knowledge is most important.</li>
		<li>Cathy thinks that details about past projects and job tasks are most important.</li>
		<li>Doug thinks publications are most important</li>
		<li>Emma thinks skills/technical knowledge and publications are important.</li>
		</ol>
		<li><i>What additional information would you want to see that is not covered?</i>
		<ol type="A">
		<li>Andy wants to know if I specialize in any of his favorite subjects (I do not).</li>
		<li>Betty would like information on grants I have worked on</li>
		<li>Cathy wants to know more about my educational history; which classes taken and what they covered.</li>
		<li>Doug wants more information about my research and/or path toward tenure.</li>
		<li>Emma wants a page describing specifically how I am able to help faculty.</li>
		</ol></li>

<h3>Reference websites</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://web.mst.edu/~longsuz/">Dr. Suzanna Long</a> - I like the general navigation and organization of this site, though the specific coding is dated and not accessibility-friendly.</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/rolla.k12.mo.us/rjh-library-ingram/home">Rolla Junior High Library</a> - This is a site designed by an academic librarian at a Junior High School. She was required by the school to use the google classroom platform and was able to make good use of sidebar navigation. The images included are very large, however, and cause the user to have to scroll a lot in order to find information. Also, images are not supplied with “alt” tags.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.fergflor.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=3379">Dr. Joseph S. Davis</a> - This site is a good example of making content work within an employer’s web framework. The content is well organized and additional documents are easily identified and summarized within the site. Dr. Davis also has a nicely framed professional photo.</li>
	<li><a href="http://carnaghiteachingportfolio.weebly.com/index.html">Ms. Megan Carnaghi</a> - I like the inclusion of letters of reference on this site. The page appears very colorful, but not distracting because most of the color comes from the header image. The actual content can then be coded in basic black text on a white background (with red links) and not appear too dull because of strategically placed photos of her classroom. Pages do require scrolling to view all information, but not excessively so.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.lilyzacharias.com/">Lily Zacharias</a> - This page was built to promote a journalist/photographer, so the style itself is very different than I would use. The organization is good, and I like the personalized domain name. The text is a bit too casual for my purposes.</li>
	<li><a href="https://dougblack.io/index.html">Doug Black</a> - The homepage for this site has very little on it but is obviously styled as a play on words of the subject’s surname. That is clever, but the lack of navigation on any other page except the homepage is distracting and cumbersome to the user.</li></ul>
	
<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
<h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
<p>The bulk of the content will be information drawn directly from my C.V. and structured similarly. Based on the survey, I would like to include a page for past grants rather than just listing them as part of my prior work history. For now, I will group them with my papers and rename the page Papers/Grants as I will not have any published conference proceedings prior to the end of this site design.</p>

<h2>Rationale for Organization</h2>
<p>This site is set up to be relatively similar to my curriculum vitae. The sections will mirror those on the submitted C.V. but will have more details so as to provide additional information and context. All pages will include consistent navigation along the top and specific anchor-based navigation in the sidebar. They will all have the same color schemes.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>
<p>The site will primarily consist of personally written text. </p>
<ul><li>There will be a professional-style photograph on the home page so that users can identify me, with copyright credit given to the photographer.</li>
	<li>There will also be additional graphics in the form of logos for the respective schools/organizations. Links to the webpages of these organizations will be included.</li>
	<li>Links and graphic logos may be provided for prior work history according to the designs of prior employers, along with details of projects and assignments completed with those organizations.</li>
	<li>Technological resources will be listed and may include brief summaries of what those resources are and how they are used.</li>
	<li>The publications page may include abstracts/summaries of included documents as well as citation information and links to download pdfs of the referenced documents, as allowable by copyright law.</li></ul>
<p>All images and graphics throughout the site will be credited with appropriate copyright information.</p>

<h2>Color Scheme and Rationale</h2>
<p>I based my color scheme off the one used by the Rolla Public Library. I find those colors to be very soothing, but also eye-catching at the same time in close to a sepia tone but with a pop of color from the maroon. The background is an off-white/taupe color and the font is a dark grey. Heading font and navigation buttons will be maroon.</p>
<p>I will use #e6e6cc as the background color, #333333 as the grey font color, and #660033 as the maroon pop of color for highlighting specific areas.</p>

<div style="background-color:#e6e6cc">#E6E6CC</div>
<div style="background-color:#333333">#333333</div>
<div style="background-color:#660033">#660033</div>
