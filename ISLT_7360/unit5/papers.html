            The Impact of Mobile Devices in Libraries</h3>
        <p>As e-readers and mobile devices increase in popularity, libraries are finding it necessary to adapt their technology and services to meet new demands and patron expectations. As patrons embrace these new technologies, so too must libraries and many are finding innumerable benefits to both patrons and staff.</p>

            Legal and Ethical Aspects of Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>The abilities provided by nearly infinite storage are a powerful tool for records managers in permanently retaining records and information, but the question must be asked of whether or not these records should be kept and for how long. This paper attempts to prompt thoughtfulness in assigning retention schedules based on the benefits of permanency as well as the potential drawbacks, including financial, legal and ethical aspects of the decision.</p>
