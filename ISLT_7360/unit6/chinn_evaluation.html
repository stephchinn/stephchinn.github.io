    <h2>Evaluation participants</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Betty</b> - Betty is a co-worker who is also serving on search committees within the library. 
            She has served on several search committees in the past and advised on hiring for numerous librarians over the years. 
            For this evaluation, she used a Dell Optiplex 7020 running Windows 10 and viewed the site in Google Chrome Version 72.0.3626.119 using a wired institutional internet connection.

        <li><b>Carol</b> - Carol is another co-worker who has served on search committees in the library and also advises on the hiring of librarians. 
            She is also a graduate student who will be seeking a librarian position and is interested in modeling the path of her coursework to fit the qualifications for a future position. 
            For this evaluation, she used a Dell Optiplex 7020 running Windows 10 and viewed the site in Google Chrome Version 72.0.3626.121 using a wired institutional internet connection.

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>The primary purpose of the site is to serve as additional information for a curriculum vitae (C.V.) and all users recognized that. 
            Other intended uses were to serve as an information page for patrons and faculty, but that use is not met by the current design. Support for those users will likely be abandoned as they would require a completely different structure and information set.
            Additionally, the page was intended to serve as information for students and/or future job seekers to demonstrate the skills and knowledge of someone currently holding a position, but again, that use was not recognized, even by the evaluator who is a current graduate student and future job-seeker.
        </p>

        <h2>Recommended / Planned changes to the design</h2>
        <p>The following changes were recommended and will be adopted to improve usability and aesthetics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One spelling error was noticed, as well as having all page titles the same. 
                Those corrections will be easily made.</li>
            <li>More comprehensive contact information will be added and the footer updated to increase font size as well as reflect the updated date, rather than the created date.</li>
            <li>Software packages will be linked out to their manufacturer's websites as well as having brief descriptions of what the software does and/or how it is used in a library and/or academic setting.</li>
            <li>Some effort must be made to improve navigation and images added to break up lengthy text blocks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection on evaluation process</h2>
        <p>It was useful to have additional sets of eyes to evaluate the site, not only for content, but for coding purposes. 
            Co-workers familiar with the library environment and hiring process were useful for evaluating general content, but it was also beneficial to have other read through and evalate. 
            Non-library users were able to pay closer attention to style details and not be so consumed with the actual content.
            I particularly appreciated the input of my friend who is a former web-developer; he was able to look closely at the html and css and ask intelligent questions about the structure of the site that should help with improving the overall feel and efficiency of the site.</p>
